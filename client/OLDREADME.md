README will actually be used to have thorough set up instructions for readers. This will be done in the very end.
For now it will be used as a brainstorming space

Creating a space to break the problem down

Objective: Write tests to ensure your API works correctly and your component(s) render correctly
Jest will help you measure code coverage of your tests. Must create unit tests for server and
client side at least. Advanced -- create integration tests for API and database. Eventuslly there
should be end to end tests for the whole intereface.
Show code coverage for all tests using Jest

Tasks
#Create test cases in using Jest and Enzyme
    -figure out how to use jest and enzyme
    -implement a single test with hardcoded data
    -try to make the test true
    -find out how to do continuos integration(Circle CI)
