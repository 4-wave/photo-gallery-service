README will actually be used to have thorough set up instructions for readers. This will be done in the very end.
For now it will be used as a brainstorming space

Creating a space to break the problem down

Objective: Write tests to ensure your API works correctly and your component(s) render correctly
Jest will help you measure code coverage of your tests. Must create unit tests for server and
client side at least. Advanced -- create integration tests for API and database. Eventuslly there
should be end to end tests for the whole intereface.
Show code coverage for all tests using Jest

Tasks
#Create test cases in using Jest and Enzyme
    -figure out how to use jest and enzyme
    -implement a single test with hardcoded data
    -try to make the test true
    -find out how to do continuos integration(Circle CI)

#Outline how the Component should Look
    -render five images on the front page
    -Css should worry about how they line up, based on classname
    -react shold change their classname one hover and css should highlight or unhighlight
    -later worry about them being able to click   

#Create tests that satisfy the outline

#Create the relative React components
    -Create the photo Gallery
    -Create the Share and Save button
    -Create the View Photos button
    -Looks like some of the photos actually have a description or 'verified by airbnb lines'
    -OR others just use the title of the property and put that instead
